# COMPASS-Analysis
COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)

This is a simple analysis on the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Scores that were contested by Pro Publica claiming that they were racially biased against the black population. Northpoint (the creator of COMPAS) published a 37-page rebuttle refuting the bias claims defending their software. This is a minor analysis to see if either side claims are substantiated.
